      // start with strings, numbers and booleans -----------------------
      let num1 = 10;
      let num2 = num1;
      console.log(num1, num2);
      num1 = 20;
      console.log(num1, num2);

      let text1 = "text1";
      let text2 = text1;
      console.log(text1, text2);
      text1 = "text2";
      console.log(text1, text2);

      // Let's say we have an array
      const players = ["Wes", "Sarah", "Ryan", "Poppy"];

      // and we want to make a copy of it. -----------------------
      const team = players;
      console.log(team, players);

      // You might think we can just do something like this: -----------------------
      // team[3] = "lux";

      // however what happens when we update that array? -----------------------
      console.log(team, players);

      // now here is the problem!
      // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
      // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!
      // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

      // solution #1 -----------------------
      team2 = players.slice();
      team2[3] = "AAA";
      console.log(team2, players);

      // solution #2 : create a new array and concat the old one in -----------------------
      team3 = [].concat(players);
      team3[3] = "BBB";
      console.log(team3, players);

      // solution #3 : use the new ES6 Spread -----------------------
      const team4 = [...players];
      team4[3] = "CCC";
      console.log(team4, players);

      // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

      // solution #4 : use Array.form()
      const team5 = Array.from(players);
      team5[3] = "DDD";
      console.log(team5, players);

      // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object
      // with Objects
      const person = {
        name: "Wes Bos",
        age: 80,
      };

      // and think we make a copy:
      const captain = person;
      captain.number = 99;
      console.log(captain, person);

      // how do we take a copy instead?

      // solution #1 : Object.assign()
      const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 100, age: 12 });
      console.log(cap2, person);

      // solution #2 : We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
      const cap3 = { ...person };
      cap3.number = 1000;
      console.log(cap3, person);

      // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
      const wes = {
        name: "wes",
        age: 100,
        socials: {
          twitter: "JJJ",
          facebook: "LLL",
        },
      };
      // const copy1 = wes;
      // wes.socials.twitter = "hee";
      // console.log(wes, copy1);

      const copy2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes));
      wes.socials.twitter = "PPP";
